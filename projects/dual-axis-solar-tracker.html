        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Automatic Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System is a renewable energy project designed to maximize solar panel efficiency by automatically following the sun's movement across the sky throughout the day. Unlike fixed solar panels that remain stationary and only receive optimal sunlight for a few hours daily, this dual-axis tracker dynamically adjusts both horizontally (azimuth) and vertically (altitude) to maintain perpendicular alignment with the sun's rays, significantly increasing energy capture. The system uses light-dependent resistors (LDRs) as sensors to detect light intensity from different directions and servo motors to adjust the panel's position accordingly. This intelligent tracking mechanism can increase solar energy collection by 30-40% compared to fixed installations, making solar power systems more efficient and cost-effective. The project demonstrates practical applications of automation in renewable energy and represents a sustainable solution for optimizing solar power generation.</p>
        
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Traditional fixed solar panel installations suffer from a significant efficiency problem—they can only maintain optimal orientation toward the sun for a brief period each day. As the sun moves across the sky from sunrise to sunset and its angle changes with seasons, fixed panels spend most of the day receiving sunlight at suboptimal angles, substantially reducing power output. This inefficiency means that expensive solar panels are underutilized, generating far less electricity than their potential capacity. For off-grid applications, remote locations, and areas where maximizing every watt is crucial, this represents both an economic and practical challenge. Manual adjustment of panel angles is impractical for most applications and defeats the purpose of automated solar energy systems. While commercial solar trackers exist, they're often expensive, complex, and designed for large-scale installations, making them inaccessible for small-scale applications, educational demonstrations, or developing regions where cost is a critical factor. There's a clear need for an affordable, simple, yet effective automated tracking solution that can be built with readily available components and maintained without specialized expertise.</p>
        
        <h2>Solution & Approach</h2>
        <p>Our solution employs a dual-axis mechanical system powered by two servo motors—one controlling horizontal rotation (azimuth tracking for east-west movement) and another controlling vertical tilting (altitude tracking for seasonal angle adjustment). The system uses four LDR sensors arranged in a cross pattern around the solar panel to detect light intensity from all directions. An Arduino microcontroller continuously reads these sensor values and compares them to determine the sun's position relative to the panel. When light intensity differences are detected, the Arduino calculates the required motor movements to align the panel with the brightest light source. The tracking algorithm implements a threshold-based decision system that prevents unnecessary small adjustments, reducing motor wear and power consumption. We designed a robust mechanical frame using aluminum extrusion and custom 3D-printed mounting brackets that can support panels up to 50W while remaining lightweight and weather-resistant. The servo motors provide precise angular control with sufficient torque to handle the panel's weight and wind resistance. A protective circuit with voltage regulation ensures stable operation even with fluctuating solar panel output. The system operates autonomously from sunrise to sunset, automatically entering a standby mode during darkness to conserve power, and returns to the eastern facing position at dawn ready to track the sun's movement throughout the new day.</p>
        
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>The project is built around an Arduino Uno microcontroller chosen for its simplicity, adequate I/O pins, and widespread support in the maker community. We use four GL5528 photoresistors (LDRs) as light sensors, providing voltage divider circuits for analog readings. Two MG996R high-torque servo motors handle the mechanical movement, offering 10kg-cm torque sufficient for moving the panel assembly smoothly. The mechanical structure consists of aluminum extrusion rails for strength and corrosion resistance, with 3D-printed PLA plastic mounts and brackets for custom components. A 12V 2A power supply provides system power, with a 7805 voltage regulator stepping down to 5V for the Arduino. The solar panel used for testing is a 20W polycrystalline panel, though the design scales to larger panels with appropriate servo upgrades. We implemented a simple analog filtering circuit to reduce LDR noise from clouds and shadows. The tracking algorithm is programmed in C++ using Arduino IDE, implementing proportional control logic where motor movement speed corresponds to the magnitude of light intensity difference. Custom PCB design was created in EasyEDA for professional circuit implementation, though breadboard prototypes work perfectly for testing. Weather protection uses clear acrylic covers for electronics and waterproof enclosures for sensitive components, making the system suitable for outdoor deployment.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges & Learnings</h2>
        <p>One of our primary challenges was dealing with intermittent light conditions—clouds passing overhead caused erratic tracking behavior as the system tried to follow rapid changes in light intensity. We solved this by implementing smoothing algorithms and threshold values that ignore minor fluctuations, only tracking significant light changes. Mechanical stability proved challenging initially; early prototypes experienced vibrations and imprecise positioning until we reinforced the structure and implemented gear reduction for finer control. Power management required careful consideration—the servo motors draw significant current during movement, so we optimized the tracking frequency to balance responsiveness with power consumption. We learned that continuous tracking isn't necessary; updating panel position every few minutes provides nearly identical energy gains while dramatically reducing wear on mechanical components. Weather durability testing revealed weaknesses in our initial design—we had to redesign sensor mounting to prevent water ingress and add shading baffles to prevent false light readings from reflections. Calibration procedures evolved through testing; we developed a simple initialization routine that users can perform to align the system with true north, ensuring accurate tracking throughout the day. This project taught us valuable lessons about real-world engineering constraints—theoretical optimal solutions often need practical modifications to account for environmental variability, component limitations, and economic considerations.</p>
        
        <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
        <p>Testing over multiple weeks demonstrated impressive performance improvements—our dual-axis tracker generated 35-42% more energy compared to a fixed panel of identical specifications during sunny days, with slightly lower but still significant gains (20-30%) on partly cloudy days. The tracking accuracy proved excellent, maintaining panel alignment within 5 degrees of optimal throughout the day. Power consumption for tracking motors averaged less than 2% of the energy gained, making the system highly energy-positive. The mechanical system demonstrated reliable operation through various weather conditions including moderate winds and rain. The project successfully validated the concept of using simple, low-cost components to achieve professional-level tracking performance at a fraction of the cost of commercial systems—our total build cost was approximately $80 compared to commercial trackers costing hundreds or thousands of dollars. Beyond energy metrics, the project has educational value, serving as a demonstration system at our university for teaching concepts of renewable energy, automation, and embedded systems. We've shared our design documentation and code openly, and several other students and makers have replicated and modified our design for their own applications. The project demonstrates that sustainable energy solutions don't require expensive commercial systems—with basic engineering knowledge and readily available components, effective renewable energy systems are accessible to anyone, which is particularly important for developing regions and educational institutions with limited budgets.</p>
