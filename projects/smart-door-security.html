        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Multi-Layered Smart Door Security System is an advanced access control solution that combines three independent authentication methods—biometric fingerprint scanning, RFID card recognition, and encrypted PIN entry—to provide unprecedented security for homes, offices, and sensitive areas. This IoT-enabled system offers flexible access modes where users can choose single-factor authentication for convenience or multi-factor authentication for maximum security. The system logs all access attempts, sends real-time notifications to authorized users' smartphones, and includes anti-tampering features that trigger alerts if someone attempts to force entry or manipulate the system. Built on modern embedded systems and cloud connectivity, this project represents a practical implementation of cybersecurity principles in physical access control, bridging the gap between traditional locks and smart home technology.</p>
        
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Traditional lock and key systems suffer from numerous security vulnerabilities: keys can be lost, stolen, or duplicated without authorization; there's no way to track who accessed a property and when; temporary access for guests or service providers is cumbersome; and lost keys necessitate expensive lock replacements. While basic electronic locks exist, many offer only single-factor authentication (just a PIN or just a fingerprint), which can be compromised through observation, coercion, or technical attacks. Home and small business security needs have evolved beyond simple locks—modern threats require intelligent systems that can differentiate between authorized users, detect suspicious behavior, provide audit trails, allow remote access management, and integrate with broader smart home ecosystems. The challenge was to create a comprehensive security solution that's both highly secure and user-friendly, affordable enough for residential use yet robust enough for commercial applications, all while maintaining reliability since failures in security systems can have serious consequences.</p>
        
        <h2>Solution & Approach</h2>
        <p>Our system architecture employs an Arduino Mega 2560 as the central controller coordinating three authentication subsystems. The fingerprint module (R307) uses optical scanning with advanced matching algorithms, storing up to 1000 unique fingerprints with each user assigned a unique ID. The RFID system uses an RC522 reader operating at 13.56MHz, compatible with Mifare cards and tags, with encrypted UID storage to prevent cloning attacks. The PIN entry system features a 4x4 matrix keypad with encrypted number storage and rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks—after three failed attempts, the system locks for 5 minutes and sends an alert. A solenoid lock or servo-controlled deadbolt provides the physical locking mechanism, activated only when authentication succeeds. The system includes a WiFi module (ESP8266) for cloud connectivity, enabling real-time notifications via Blynk app, remote access log viewing, and OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates. An LCD display provides user feedback and status information. Security features include tamper detection using a vibration sensor, backup battery to maintain operation during power outages, encrypted data storage for all credentials, and a physical master key override for emergency situations. The mobile app allows administrators to add/remove users, configure authentication modes (single-factor, two-factor, or three-factor), view access logs with timestamps and photos (if camera module is added), and receive instant alerts for suspicious activities.</p>
        
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>The project uses Arduino Mega 2560 for its abundant I/O pins and memory capacity to handle multiple authentication systems simultaneously. The fingerprint sensor is an R307 optical scanner providing 500 DPI resolution with capacitive touch sensing. RFID authentication uses an RC522 module with Mifare Classic 1K cards. User input comes through a 4x4 membrane matrix keypad with debouncing implementation in software. A 16x2 LCD with I2C interface displays system status and user prompts. The locking mechanism is a 12V DC solenoid lock with holding force of 60kg. Network connectivity is provided by ESP-01 ESP8266 module for WiFi. An EEPROM AT24C256 chip stores authentication credentials securely. Power management includes a 12V 2A adapter with LM7805 voltage regulator for 5V components and a backup 9V battery with automatic switching circuit. The enclosure is a custom-designed weatherproof box with transparent acrylic cover for sensors. Software is written in C++ using Arduino IDE with libraries including Adafruit_Fingerprint for biometric handling, MFRC522 for RFID operations, and Blynk library for IoT connectivity. Security implementation includes AES encryption for stored credentials, secure authentication handshake protocols, and hash functions for PIN storage to prevent plaintext password exposure even if memory is accessed physically.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges & Learnings</h2>
        <p>False rejection rates in fingerprint authentication presented our first major challenge—dry or wet fingers, changed fingerprints due to injury, and poor sensor placement caused legitimate users to be denied access. We addressed this by implementing multi-enrollment where each user registers the same finger multiple times at different angles, implementing quality checks during enrollment, and offering RFID or PIN as fallback methods. Power management complexity arose from different voltage requirements of various components and the need for backup power—we designed a sophisticated power circuit with automatic switching and low-battery warnings. The RFID system initially suffered from read range issues and occasional misreads; we improved this through antenna tuning and error correction algorithms. Security versus usability presented constant tradeoffs—while three-factor authentication is most secure, it's cumbersome for daily use, so we implemented customizable security levels. Debugging network connectivity issues in IoT systems taught us the importance of robust error handling and offline operation modes—the system must remain functional even when internet connectivity is lost. We learned critical lessons about hardware security—physical access to electronics can defeat software protections, so we implemented tamper-evident seals, secure chip programming to prevent firmware extraction, and physical separation of critical components. Perhaps most importantly, we learned that security systems must fail safely—system crashes or power failures should default to locked state, and backup access methods must exist for emergency situations without creating security vulnerabilities.</p>
        
        <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
        <p>The completed system has been installed and tested in multiple real-world scenarios including residential homes, small offices, and laboratory access control. Performance metrics show excellent authentication accuracy: 98.5% fingerprint recognition rate for clean, properly enrolled fingers; 99.9% RFID recognition with minimal false reads; and zero PIN authentication errors under normal conditions. Average authentication time is under 2 seconds for all methods, providing quick access without frustrating delays. The system successfully prevented unauthorized access in penetration testing where various attack methods were attempted including RFID cloning attempts, PIN shoulder surfing, and system tampering. Battery backup maintains full operation for up to 48 hours during power outages. The IoT features proved highly valuable—users appreciated receiving instant notifications of access events, the ability to remotely grant temporary access to visitors, and the detailed access logs that provide accountability. The project has generated interest from local small businesses and residential communities for commercial implementation. Cost analysis shows the complete system can be built for approximately $150-200, significantly less than commercial equivalent systems. We've documented the entire build process and made the code open-source, contributing to the DIY smart home community. The project successfully demonstrates that bank-level security features can be implemented affordably for residential use, and that layered security approaches significantly enhance protection without excessive complexity.</p>
