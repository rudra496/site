        <h2>Background & Journey</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Rudra Sarker, a passionate engineering student and technology enthusiast currently pursuing my degree in Industrial and Production Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) in Sylhet, Bangladesh. My journey into the world of engineering began with a childhood fascination for how things work—from disassembling old electronics to building my first LED circuit. That curiosity has evolved into a comprehensive skill set spanning robotics, IoT systems, software development, and industrial process optimization.</p>
        
        <p>What drives me is the belief that engineering is not just about building things, but about creating solutions that make a real difference in people's lives. Whether it's developing assistive technologies for people with disabilities, creating sustainable energy solutions, or building intelligent automation systems, I strive to work on projects that have meaningful impact. My approach combines technical excellence with a deep understanding of user needs and practical constraints.</p>
        
        <h2>Education & Academic Pursuits</h2>
        <p>As a third-year student in Industrial and Production Engineering at SUST, I'm developing a strong foundation in manufacturing systems, operations research, quality control, and supply chain management. However, my learning extends far beyond the classroom. I actively participate in online courses, technical workshops, and hands-on projects to expand my knowledge in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced embedded systems.</p>
        
        <p>My academic work has given me valuable insights into process optimization, lean manufacturing principles, and statistical analysis—skills that complement my technical projects perfectly. This interdisciplinary background allows me to approach engineering challenges from multiple perspectives, considering not just technical feasibility but also efficiency, scalability, and economic viability.</p>
        
        <h2>Technical Skills & Expertise</h2>
        <p>My technical toolkit is diverse and constantly growing. In the realm of embedded systems and robotics, I work extensively with Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi platforms. I'm proficient in programming languages including C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and have hands-on experience with web frameworks like React, Node.js, Flask, and Django. My IoT projects involve sensor integration, wireless communication protocols (WiFi, Bluetooth, MQTT), and cloud platforms for data management.</p>
        
        <p>For robotics and automation, I specialize in PID control algorithms, sensor fusion, computer vision using OpenCV, and motor control systems. I'm also developing skills in machine learning and AI, working with libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn for various classification and prediction tasks. On the industrial engineering side, I use tools like AutoCAD, SolidWorks for design work, and MATLAB for simulation and optimization.</p>
        
        <h2>Professional Philosophy</h2>
        <p>I believe in the power of iterative development, continuous learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new, whether it succeeds spectacularly or fails instructively. I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and knowledge sharing—I regularly document my projects, share code on GitHub, and engage with the maker and developer communities.</p>
        
        <p>My problem-solving approach is systematic yet creative. I start by thoroughly understanding the problem space, researching existing solutions, and then designing an approach that balances innovation with practicality. I believe in prototyping early and often, using feedback to refine and improve solutions iteratively.</p>
        
        <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
        <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to work at the intersection of industrial engineering and advanced technology, potentially in roles involving industrial automation, smart manufacturing, or robotics engineering. I'm particularly interested in applications of AI and IoT in industrial settings, sustainable engineering practices, and the development of assistive technologies. My ultimate goal is to contribute to innovations that make industrial processes more efficient while creating technologies that improve quality of life for people around the world.</p>
